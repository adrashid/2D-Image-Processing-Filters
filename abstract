Two-dimensional (2D) image processing systems are concerned with the processing of the images represented as 2D arrays and are widely used in
medicine, transportation and many other autonomous systems. The dynamics of these systems are generally modeled using 2D difference equations, which are
mathematically analyzed using the 2D z-transform. It mainly involves a transformation of the difference equations based models of these systems to their
corresponding algebraic equations, mapping the 2D arrays (2D discrete-time signals) over the (z1,z2)-domain. Finally, these (z1,z2)-domain representations
are used to analyze various properties of these systems, such as transfer function and stability. Conventional techniques, such as paper-and-pencil proof methods
and computer based simulation techniques for analyzing these filters cannot assert the accuracy of the analysis due to their inherent limitations like human
error proneness, limited computational resources and approximations of the mathematical expressions and results. In this paper, as a complimentary
technique, we propose to use formal methods, higher-order-logic theorem proving, for formally analyzing the image processing filters. These methods can overcome
the limitations of the conventional techniques and thus ascertain the accuracy of the analysis. In particular, we formalize the 2D z-transform based on the
multivariate theories of calculus using the HOL Light theorem prover. Moreover, we formally analyze a generic (L1, L2)-order 2D Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)
image processing filter. We illustrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed approach by formally analyzing a second-order image processing filter.
